Tele-medicine application which runs on KIOSKs in places devoid of 
smartphones and on any platform (android/ios/web). It will make healthcare 
accessible to people in remote and rural areas, which are often missed out by 
our healthcare system. The prototype will function as follows:
* It allows patients to reach out to a KIOSK nearby and effortlessly login 
using biometrics and explain their condition to a conversational Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) chatbot. 
* People with low-literacy rate can use the text-to-speech or IVR 
(Interactive Voice Response) Systems to provide information regarding 
their condition to the chatbot
* The chatbot is made using Large Language Models (LLMs) which 
parses the patient's input and matches with the known symptoms
* Our Machine Learning (ML) model uses the provided symptoms to 
determine possible diseases/illnesses and display to the current patient
* The application will suggest possible doctors based on their specialities 
and the determined condition of the user using our doctor 
recommendation algorithm made using Machine Learning (ML)
* The application protects user data as the data is end-to-end encrypted 
* Our application can be accessed even offline as our tele-medicine 
chatbots would be accessible via SMS
